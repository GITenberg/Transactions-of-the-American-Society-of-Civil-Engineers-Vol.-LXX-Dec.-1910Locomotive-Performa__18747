<p>In the location of new railways and the improvement of lines
already in operation, it is now well recognized that large economies
can be effected by the careful study of train resistance due to grades
and alignment, distributing this resistance so as to secure a minimum
cost of operation with the means available for construction.</p>

<p>While engaged in such studies some years ago, the attention of the
writer was attracted by the fact that the usual method of calculating
the traction of a locomotive&mdash;by assuming from 20 to 25% of the
weight on the drivers&mdash;was subject to no small modification in practice.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a working basis, for use in relation to this
feature, he undertook the collection of data from the practical operation
of various roads. Subsequent engagements in an entirely different
direction caused this to be laid aside until the present time. The
results are given in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, from which it will be seen that the
percentage of driver weight utilized in draft is a function of the
length as well as the rate of grade encountered in the practical operation
of railways.</p>

<p>In this table, performance will be found expressed as the percentage
of the weight on the drivers which is utilized in draft. This
is calculated on a basis of 6 lb. per ton of train resistance, for dates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>prior to 1880, this being the amount given by the late A.&nbsp;M. Wellington,
M. Am. Soc. C..&nbsp;E.,<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and 4.7 lb. per ton for those of 1908-10, as
obtained by A.&nbsp;C. Dennis, M. Am. Soc. C.&nbsp;E.,<a name="FNanchor_B_4" id="FNanchor_B_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_4" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> assuming this difference
to represent the advance in practice from 1880 to the present
time. Most of the data have been obtained from the "Catalogue of
the Baldwin Locomotive Works" for 1881, to which have been added
some later figures from "Record No. 65" of the same establishment,
and also some obtained by the writer directly from the roads concerned.
Being taken thus at random, the results may be accepted as
fairly representative of American practice.</p>

<p>Attention should be directed to the fact that the performance of
the 10-34&nbsp;E, Consolidation locomotive on the Lehigh Valley Railroad
in 1871 is practically equal to that of the latest Mallet compounds on
the Great Northern Railway. In other words, in the ratio between
the ability to produce steam and the weight on the drivers there has
been no change in the last forty years. This would indicate that the
figures are not likely to be changed much as long as steam-driven
locomotives are in use. What will obtain with the introduction of
electric traction is "another story."</p>

<p>These results have also been platted, and are presented in <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>,
with the lengths of grade as abscissas and the percentages of weight
utilized as ordinates. The curve sketched to represent a general
average will show the conditions at a glance. The results may at first
sight seem irregular, but the agreement is really remarkable when the
variety of sources is considered; that in many cases the "reputed" rate
of grade is doubtless given without actual measurement; that the
results also include momentum, the ability to utilize which depends
on the conditions of grade, alignment, and operating practice which
obtain about the foot of each grade; and that the same amount of
energy due to momentum will carry a train farther on a light grade
than on a heavy one.</p>

<p>There are four items in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> which vary materially from the
general consensus. For Item 9, the authorities of the road particularly
state that their loads are light, because, owing to the congested
condition of their business, their trains must make fast time. Item 10
represents very old practice, certainly prior to 1882, and is "second-hand."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>The load consisted of empty coal cars, and the line was very
tortuous, so that it is quite probable that the resistance assumed in
the calculation is far below the actual. Items 15 and 17 are both
high. To account for this, it is to be noted that this road has been
recently completed, regardless of cost in the matter of both track and
rolling stock, and doubtless represents the highest development of
railroad practice. Its rolling stock is all new, and is probably in
better condition to offer low resistance than it will ever be again, and
there were no "foreign" cars in the trains considered. The train
resistance, therefore, may be naturally assumed to be much less than
that of roads hauling all classes of cars, many of which are barely
good enough to pass inspection. As the grades are light in both cases,
this feature of train resistance is larger than in items including
heavier grades. Attention should be called to the fact that a line
connecting the two points representing these items on <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> would
make only a small angle with the sketched curve, and would be
practically parallel to a similar line connecting the points represented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
by Items 13 and 16. There is, therefore, an agreement of ratios, which
is all that needs consideration in this discussion.</p>

<p>Wellington, in his monumental work on railway location, presents
a table of this character. The percentages of weight on the drivers
which is utilized in draft show the greatest irregularity. He does
not give the length of the grades considered, so that it is impossible
to say how far the introduction of this feature would have contributed
to bring order out of the chaos. In his discussion of the table he
admits the unsatisfactory character of the results, and finally decides
on 25% as a rough average, "very approximately the safe operating
load in regular service." He further states that a number of results,
which he omits for want of space, exceeds 33 per cent. The highest
shown in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> will be found in Item 1 (0.06 mile, 0.066 grade),
showing 33 per cent. There is no momentum effect here, as the grade
is a short incline extending down to the river, and the start is necessarily
a "dead" one. The reports of Item 3, which shows 31%, and
Item 5, which shows 27%, state specifically that the locomotives will
stop and start the loads given at any point on the grade.</p>

<p>The results of a series of experiments reported by Mr. A.&nbsp;C. Dennis
in his paper, "Virtual Grades for Freight Trains," previously referred
to, indicate a utilization of somewhat more than 23%, decreasing
with the speed.</p>

<p>All this indicates that the general failure of locomotives to utilize
more than from 16 to 18% on long grades, as shown by <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, can
only be due to the failure of the boilers to supply the necessary steam.
While the higher percentage shown for the shorter grades may be
ascribed largely to momentum present when the foot of the grade is
reached, the energy due to stored heat is responsible for a large
portion of it.</p>

<p>When a locomotive has been standing still, or running with the
steam consumption materially below the production, the pressure
accumulates until it reaches the point at which the safety valve is
"set." This means that the entire machine is heated to a temperature
sufficient to maintain this pressure in the boiler. When the steam consumption
begins to exceed the production, this temperature is reduced
to a point where the consumption and production balance.</p>

<p>The heat represented by this difference in temperature has passed
into the steam used, thus adding to the energy supplied by the combustion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
going on in the furnace. The engines, therefore, are able to
do considerably more work during the time the pressure is falling
than they can do after the fall has ceased.</p>

<p>The curve in <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> would indicate that the energy derived from
the two sources just discussed is practically dissipated at 15 miles,
though the position of the points representing Items 16, 18, 19, 20,
and 21 would indicate that this takes place more frequently between
10 and 12 miles. From this point onward the performance depends on
the efficiency of the steam production, which does not appear to be
able to utilize more than 16% of the weight on the drivers. The
diagrams presented by Mr. Dennis in his paper on virtual grades,
and by John A. Fulton, M. Am. Soc. C.&nbsp;E., in his discussion of that
paper, indicate that similar results would be shown were they extended
to include the distance named.</p>

<p>From this it would appear that a locomotive is capable of hauling
a larger train on grades less than 10 miles in length than on longer
grades, and that, even when unexpectedly stopped, it is capable of
starting again as soon as the steam pressure is sufficiently built up.
Conversely, it should be practicable to use a higher rate of ascent on
shorter grades on any given line without decreasing the load which
can be hauled over it. In other words, what is known as the "ruling
grade" is a function, strictly speaking, of the length as well as the
rate of grade.</p>

<p>In any discussions of the practicability of using a higher rate
on the short grades, which the writer has seen, the most valid
objection has appeared to be the danger of stalling and consequent
delay. As far as momentum is relied on, this objection is valid.
Within the limits of the load which can be handled by the steam, it
has small value, as it is only a question of waiting a few minutes
until the pressure can be built up to the point at which the load can be
handled. As this need only be an occasional occurrence, it is not to
be balanced against any material saving in cost of construction.</p>

<p>The writer does not know of any experiments which will throw
much light on the value of heat storage as separated from momentum,
though the following discussion may prove suggestive:</p>

<p>A train moving at a rate of 60 ft. per sec., and reaching the foot
of a grade, will have acquired a "velocity head" of 56.7 ft., equivalent
to stored energy of 56.7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2,000&nbsp;=&nbsp;113,400&nbsp;ft-lb. per ton. On a 0.002<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
grade (as in Item 15 of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>) the resistance would be, gravity
4&nbsp;lb.&nbsp;+&nbsp;train&nbsp;4.7&nbsp;lb.&nbsp;=&nbsp;8.7&nbsp;lb., against which the energy above given
would carry the train through 113,400&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;8.7&nbsp;=&nbsp;13,034&nbsp;ft., say, 2.5 miles,
leaving 5 miles to be provided for by the steam production. Examining
the items in the table having grades in excess of 10 miles, it will
be noted that 16% is about all the weight on drivers which can be
utilized by the current supply of steam. In Item 15 the energy
derived from all sources is equivalent to 24.3%; hence the stored heat
may be considered as responsible for an equivalent of 24.3%&nbsp;-&nbsp;16%&nbsp;=&nbsp;8.3%
for a distance of 5 miles.</p>

<p>In proportioning grade resistance for any line, therefore, a locomotive
may be counted on to utilize 24.3% of the weight on the drivers
for a distance of 5 miles on a 0.002 grade without any assistance from
momentum, and, in the event of an unexpected stop, should be able, as
soon as a full head of steam is built up, to start the train and carry
it over the grade. This is probably a maximum, considering the condition
of the equipment of this Virginian Railway, as previously
mentioned.</p>

<p>Treating Item 14 in the same way, a distance of 2,310 ft. is
accounted for by momentum, leaving, say, 5.5 miles for the steam, or
the length of a 0.02 grade on which a locomotive may be loaded on a
basis of tractive power equal to 24.2% of the weight on the drivers.</p>

<p>From these figures it may be concluded that on lines having grades
from 12 to 15 or more miles in length, grades of 3 to 5 miles in
length may be inserted having rates 50% in excess of that of the long
grades, without decreasing the capacity of the line. This statement,
of course, is general in its bearings, each case being subject to its
especial limitations, and subject to detailed calculations.</p>

<p>It may be noted that the velocity of 60 ft. per sec., assumed at the
foot of the grade, is probably higher than should be expected in
practice; it insures, on the other hand, that quite enough has been
allowed for momentum, and that the results are conservative.</p>

<p>Arguments like the foregoing are always more or less treacherous;
being based on statistics, they are naturally subject to material modifications
in the presence of a larger array of data, therefore, material
assistance in reaching practical conclusions can be given by the
presentation of additional data.</p>

<h2><a name="DISCUSSION" id="DISCUSSION"></a>DISCUSSION</h2>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">C.&nbsp;D. Purdon, M. Am. Soc. C.&nbsp;E.</span> (by letter).&mdash;Some years ago the
writer, in making studies for grade revision, found that the tractive
power of a locomotive up grade becomes less as the length of the
grade increases, and in some unknown proportion. This was a practical
confirmation of the saying of locomotive engineers, that the engine
"got tired" on long grades. On a well-known Western railroad, with
which the writer is familiar, experiments were made for the purpose
of rating its locomotives. The locomotives were first divided into
classes according to their tractive power, this being calculated by the
usual rule, with factors of size of cylinders, boiler pressure, and diameter
of drivers, also by taking one-fourth of the weight on the drivers,
and using the lesser of the two results as the tractive power.</p>

<p>Locomotives of different classes, and hauling known loads, were run
over a freight division, the cars being weighed for the purpose; thus
the maximum load which could be handled over a division, or different
parts of a division, was ascertained, and this proportion of tonnage
to tractive power was used in rating all classes.</p>

<p>Of course, this method was not mathematically accurate, as the
condition of track, the weather, and the personal equation of the
locomotive engineers all had an effect, but, later, when correcting the
rating by tests with dynamometers, it was found that the results were
fairly practical.</p>

<p>There were three hills where the rate of grade was the same as the
rest of the division, but where the length was much in excess of other
grades of the same rate.</p>

<p>Designating these hills as <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>, the lengths are, respectively,
2.44, 3.57, and 4.41 miles. There were no other grades of the same
rate exceeding 1 mile.</p>

<p>In one class of freight engines, 10-wheel Brooks, the weight of the
engine was 197,900 lb.; tender, 132,800 lb.; weight on drivers, 142,600
lb.; boiler pressure, 200 lb.; and tractive power of cylinders, 33,300 lb.</p>

<p>On Hill <i>A</i> these engines are rated at 865 tons, as compared with
945 on other parts of the division. As the engine weighs 165 tons and
the caboose 15 tons, 180 tons should be added, making the figures, 1,045
and 1,125 tons. Thus the length of the grade, 2.44 miles, makes the
tractive power on it 92% of that on shorter grades.</p>

<p>On Hill <i>B</i>, the rating, adding 180 tons as above, is 1,160 and
1,230 tons, respectively, giving 94% for 3.57 miles.</p>

<p>On Hill <i>C</i>, the rating, with 180 tons added, is 1,130 and 1,230 tons,
making 92% for 4.41 miles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Taking the same basis as the author, namely, 4.7 lb. per ton, rate
of grade &times; 20, and weight on drivers, gives:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Hill <i>A</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;18.078%, remainder of division, 19.462%<br />
Hill <i>B</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;20.068%, remainder of division, 21.279%<br />
Hill <i>C</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;19.549%, remainder of division, 21.279%<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noted that the author uses the weight on the drivers as
the criterion, but the tractive power is not directly as the weight on
the drivers, some engines being over-cylindered, or under-cylindered;
in the class of engines above mentioned the tractive power is 23.35%
of the weight on the drivers.</p>

<p>The writer made a study of several dynamometer tests on Hill <i>C</i>.
There is a grade of the same rate, about 1 mile long, near this hill,
and a station near its foot, but there is sufficient level grade between
this station and the foot of the hill to get a good start.</p>

<p>All the engines of the above class, loaded for Hill <i>C</i>, gained speed
on the 1-mile grade, but began to fall below the theoretical speed at a
point about 2-1/4 miles from the foot of the hill. This condition occurred
when the trains stopped at the station and also when they passed it
at a rate of some 16 or 18 miles per hour, the speed becoming less
and less as the top of the hill was approached.</p>

<p>The writer concludes that the author might stretch his opinion as
to using heavier rates of grade on shorter hills than 10 miles, and
indeed his diagram seems to intimate as much, and that, for economical
operation, the maximum rate of grade should be reduced after a
length of about 2 miles has been reached, and more and more in
proportion to the length of the hill, in order that the same rating
could be applied all over a division.</p>

<p>This conclusion might be modified by local conditions, such as an
important town where cars might be added to or taken from the
train.</p>

<p>While it does not seem practicable to the writer to calculate what
the reduction of rate of grade should be, a consensus of results of
operation on different lengths of grade might give sufficient data to
reach some conclusion on the matter.</p>

<p>The American Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way
Association has a Committee on "Railway Economics," which is studying
such matters, but so far as the writer knows it has not given this
question any consideration.</p>

<p>The writer hopes that the author will follow up this subject, and
that other members will join, as a full discussion will no doubt bring
some results on a question which seems to be highly important.</p>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">John C. Trautwine, Jr., Assoc. Am. Soc</span>. C.&nbsp;E. (by letter).&mdash;In
his collection of data, Mr. Randolph includes two ancient cases
taken from the earliest editions (1872-1883) of Trautwine's "Civil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Engineer's Pocket-Book," referring to performances on the Mahanoy
and Broad Mountain Railroad (now the Frackville Branch of the
Reading) and on the Pennsylvania Railroad, respectively.</p>

<p>In the private notes of John C. Trautwine, Sr., these two cases
are recorded as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On the Mahanoy &amp; Broad Mtn. R.&nbsp;R., <i>tank</i> Engines of 35 tons, <i>all
on 8 drivers</i>, draw 40 <i>empty</i> coal cars weighing 100 tons, <i>up</i> a continuous
grade of 175 ft. per mile for 3-1/2 miles; &amp; around curves of
450, 500, 600 ft. &amp;c. rad., at 8 miles an hour. (1864) This is equal to
77-14/100 tons for a 27-ton engine." (Vol. III, p. 176.)</p>

<p>"On the Penn Central 95 ft. grades for 9-3/4 miles, a 29-ton engine
all on 8 drivers takes 125 tons of freight and 112 tons of engine, tender,
&amp; cars, in all 237 tons,<a name="FNanchor_C_5" id="FNanchor_C_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_5" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and a passenger engine takes up 3 cars at
24 miles an hour (large 8 wheels). When more than 3, an auxiliary
engine."</p></div>

<p>It will be seen that Mr. Randolph is well within bounds in ascribing
to the Mahanoy and Broad Mountain case (his No. 10) a date
"certainly prior to 1882," the date being given, in the notes, as 1864;
while another entry just below it, for the Pennsylvania Railroad case,
is dated 1860.</p>

<p>It also seems, as stated by Mr. Randolph, quite probable that the
frictional resistance (6 lb. per 2,000 lb.) assumed by him in the calculation
is far below the actual for this Case 10. The small, empty, four-wheel
cars weighed only 4,400 lb. each. Furthermore, the "tons," in
the Trautwine reports of these experiments, were tons of 2,240 lb.
On the other hand, the maximum curvature was 12&deg; 45' (not 14&deg;, as
given by the author), and the engine was a tank locomotive, whereas
the author has credited it with a 25-ton tender.</p>

<p>After making all corrections, it will be found that, in order to bring
the point, for this Case 10, up to the author's curve, instead of his
6 lb. per 2,000 lb., a frictional resistance of 66 lb. per 2,000 lb. would
be required, a resistance just equal to the gravity resistance on the
3.3% grade, making a total resistance of 132 lb. per 2,000 lb.</p>

<p>While this 66 lb. per ton is very high, it is perhaps not too high
for the known conditions, as above described. For modern rolling
stock, Mr. A.&nbsp;K. Shurtleff gives the formula:<a name="FNanchor_D_6" id="FNanchor_D_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_6" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>


<div class='center'>

</div>

<p>where <i>C</i> = weight of car and load, in tons of 2,000 lb. This would
give, for 4,400-lb. (2.2-ton) cars, a frictional resistance of 42 lb. per
2,000 lb.; and, on the usual assumption of 0.8 lb. per 2,000 lb. for each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
degree of curvature, the 12.75&deg; curves of this line would give 10 lb.
per ton additional, making a total of 52 lb. per 2,000 lb. over and above
grade resistance, under modern conditions.</p>

<p>In the 9th to 17th editions of Trautwine (1885-1900), these early
accounts were superseded by numerous later instances, including some
of those quoted by the author.</p>

<p>In the 18th and 19th editions (1902-1909) are given data respecting
performances on the Catawissa Branch of the Reading (Shamokin
Division) in 1898-1901. These give the maximum and minimum loads
hauled up a nearly continuous grade of 31.47 ft. per mile (0.59%) from
Catawissa to Lofty (34.03 miles) by engines of different classes, with
different helpers and without helpers.</p>

<p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> (in which the writer follows the author in assuming frictional
resistance at 4.7 lb. per 2,000 lb.) shows the cases giving the
maximum and minimum values of the quantity represented by the
ordinates in the author's diagram, namely, "Traction, in percentage
of weight on drivers."</p>

<p>It will be seen that the maximum percentage (16.1) is practically
identical with that found by the author (16) for grade lengths exceeding
17 miles.</p>

<p>Near the middle of the 34-mile distance there is a stretch of 1.51
miles, on which the average grade is only 5.93 ft. per mile (0.112%),
and this stretch divides the remaining distance into two practically
continuous grades, 19.39 and 13.13 miles long, respectively; but, as the
same loads are hauled over these two portions by the same engines, the
results are virtually identical, the maxima furnishing two more points
closely coinciding with the author's diagram.</p>

<span class="smcap">Beverly S. Randolph, M. Am. Soc</span>. C.&nbsp;E. (by letter).&mdash;The percentages
given by Mr. Purdon would seem to indicate that the length
of the grades did not affect the loads in the cases cited, but these
percentages are so much below those shown in the table, for similar
distances, as to indicate some special conditions which the writer has
been unable to find in the text.</p>

<p>The use of the percentage of weight on drivers which is utilized
in traction as a measure of the efficiency of the locomotive, while,
probably, not applicable to individual machines, is sound for the purposes
of comparison of results to be obtained on various portions of a
line as far as affected by conditions of grade and alignment. It has the
advantage of disregarding questions of temperature, condition of track,
character of fuel, etc., which, being the same on all portions of the
line, naturally balance and do not affect the comparison. It is, of
course, simply a method of expressing the final efficiency of the various
parts of the locomotive, and, since it depends entirely on actual results
already accomplished, leaves no room for difference of opinion or
theoretical error.</p>

<p>The writer has always considered an "under-cylindered" locomotive
as a defective machine. All weight is a distinct debit, in the shape of
wear and tear of track and running gear, resistance due to gravity
on grades, interest on cost, etc. When this weight fails to earn a
credit in the way of tractive efficiency, it should not be present.</p>

<p>The statement relative to the performance of locomotives on
"Hill <i>C</i>" is interesting, especially in that it appears to have been
immaterial whether they made a dead start after stopping at the
station or approached the foot of the hill at 16 to 18 miles per hour.
The momentum would appear to be an insignificant factor.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to note that Mr. Trautwine has been able to brace
up the weak member of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> so completely with his detailed data;
also that his other results strengthen the conclusions reached in the
paper.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
